# Building a flash message component with Vue.js

This repo holds the code that goes along with my blog post on [Laravel News](https://laravel-news.com).

To set up the project, your will need PHP, Composer, Node.js, and NPM installed. Then clone this repo, run `composer install`, run `npm install`, and serve the site using [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/valet) or `php artisan serve`.
